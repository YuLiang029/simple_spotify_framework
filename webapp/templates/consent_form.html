    </p>


    <h5>6. Confidentiality</h5>
    <p>
        All research conducted at the Human-Technology Interaction Group adheres to the Code of
        Ethics of the NIP (Nederlands Instituut voor Psychologen – Dutch Institute for Psychologists),
        and this study has been approved by the Ethical Review Board of the department.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, your personal data (age, gender, participant ID, Spotify username and contact
        email) and experimental data (responses to the questionnaires, interaction time and
        interactions with the application) will be recorded, analyzed, and stored. You need to log in
        with your Spotify account in order to join this study, but your credentials will be anonymized.
        The goal of collecting, analyzing, and storing this data is to answer the research question and
        publish the results in the scientific literature. To protect your privacy, all data that can be used
        to personally identify you will be stored on an encrypted server of the Human Technology
        Interaction group for at least 10 years that is only accessible by selected HTI staff members. No
        information that can be used to personally identify you will be shared with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected in this study might also be of relevance for future research projects within
        the Human Technology Interaction group or by other researchers outside of the group. The aim
        of those studies might be unrelated to the goals of this study. The collected data might
        therefore also be made available to the authorized researchers from other institutions in an
        online data repository with restricted access (only on request). The coded data collected in this
        study and that will be released to others will (to the best of our knowledge and ability) not
        contain information that can identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom of this consent form, you can indicate whether or not you agree with the use of
        your data for future research by other researches, within the Human Technology Interaction
        group or outside. No video or audio recordings are made that could identify you.
    </p>
