    <h2>Informed consent form for participants</h2>

    <p>
        This page gives you information about the study “Music Genre Exploration”.
        Before the study begins, it is important that you learn about the procedure
        followed in this study and that you give your informed consent
        for voluntary participation. Please read this page carefully.
    </p>

    <h5>1. Aim and benefit of the study</h5>
    <p>
        The aim of this study is to measure your interaction with and evaluation of a music genre
        exploration tool. This information is used to improve such tools and see how people can best
        be guided when they want to listen to a new music genre.
    </p>
    <p>
        This study is performed by L. Peeters, T.P. Meeuwisse &amp; J.T. Hilberink, students under the
        supervision of M.C. Willemsen &amp; Y. Liang of the Human-Technology Interaction group.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Procedure</h5>
    <p>
        In this study you will log in with you Spotify account <b>(note: you can only participate with an
        active Spotify account, free or paid)</b> and select a new genre that you would like to get familiar
        with. You will be able to listen to songs that the tool provided, and answer questions about the
        application and the songs that are recommended to you. You will do two trials of this
        exploration, evaluating different versions of the tool.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Risks</h5>
    <p>
        The study does not involve any risks or detrimental side effects.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Duration</h5>
    <p>
        The study will last approximately 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Participants</h5>
    <p>
        You were selected because you were registered as participant in the participant database of
        the Human Technology Interaction group of the Eindhoven University of Technology or
        because you were personally invited via email.
    </p>

    <h5>6. Voluntary</h5>
    <p>
        Your participation is completely voluntary. You can refuse to participate without giving any
        reasons and you can stop your participation at any time during the study by closing your web
        browser. You can also withdraw your permission to use your data up to 24 hours after they
        were recorded. None of this will have any negative consequences for you whatsoever.
    </p>

    <h5>7. Compensation</h5>
    <p>
        For compensation, you will enter a lottery in which 1 in every 5 participants will receive 20
        euros. So you have a 20% chance of winning 20 euros.
    </p>

    <h5>8. Confidentiality</h5>
    <p>
        All research conducted at the Human-Technology Interaction Group adheres to the Code of
        Ethics of the NIP (Nederlands Instituut voor Psychologen – Dutch Institute for Psychologists),
        and this study has been approved by the Ethical Review Board of the department.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, your personal data (age, gender, participant ID, Spotify username and contact
        email) and experimental data (responses to the questionnaires, interaction time and
        interactions with the application) will be recorded, analyzed, and stored. You need to log in
        with your Spotify account in order to join this study, but your credentials will be anonymized.
        The goal of collecting, analyzing, and storing this data is to answer the research question and
        publish the results in the scientific literature. To protect your privacy, all data that can be used
        to personally identify you will be stored on an encrypted server of the Human Technology
        Interaction group for at least 10 years that is only accessible by selected HTI staff members. No
        information that can be used to personally identify you will be shared with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected in this study might also be of relevance for future research projects within
        the Human Technology Interaction group or by other researchers outside of the group. The aim
        of those studies might be unrelated to the goals of this study. The collected data might
        therefore also be made available to the authorized researchers from other institutions in an
        online data repository with restricted access (only on request). The coded data collected in this
        study and that will be released to others will (to the best of our knowledge and ability) not
        contain information that can identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom of this consent form, you can indicate whether or not you agree with the use of
    your data for future research by other researches, within the Human Technology Interaction
    group or outside.<br>
    No video or audio recordings are made that could identify you.
    </p>
